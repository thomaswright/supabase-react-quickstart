# Supabase React Quickstart

This is an implementation of the [react quickstart guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-react) from supabase.

The only additional file you'll need is a `.env` with `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL` and `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` variables.

`npm start` runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
